\section*{Introduction}
This was my first ever website I created so I tried my best to keep it short and concise. For title I used a catchy Lobster font to greet the reader with something "warm" and then continued in more professional font- Roboto to convey the professional tone of my work.

\section*{Heading and Footer}
Heading and footer were created mainly to practice the skill of creating them and while they were not fully utilized in this work, they will be more useful in my future projects.

\section*{Colour Usage}
Various shades of blue were used to keep the web page within certain colours and not making it too colorful while still providing some variety. Blue, white and black create a modern looking feel to the web page.

\section*{Images}
Images do a great job showcasing my work while correct usage of bold and italics separate context and highlight important information in the text.

\section*{Future Improvements}
In the future I wanna improve the contents inside footer and heading, work on how to connect several webpages, create links within images, and specifically this webpage could use more structural work by possibly adding more information and expanding on subheadings.
